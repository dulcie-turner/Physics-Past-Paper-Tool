# Physics Past Paper Tool
 Computer Science coursework for A-Level. This code was completed between 2019 and 2020 and written entirely by myself.
 
 ## The project
 Written in VB, this Windows application is designed to help a user revise for the Physics A-Level, by completing past paper questions.
 
 ## Features
 * Storage of past paper questions and associated data in an SQL Server database
 * Random generation of exams, with options for user customisation
   * The length and topics of the exam are specified by the user
   * Intelligent exam generation - incorrect questions are passed to the user to try again, and recently completed ones are avoided
* Interface for completing and marking timed exams
   * Questions are answered either by multiple choice tickbox or typed responses
   * After the exam, the user views the mark scheme & examiner's reports, and marks their answers
   * Question responses, marks and corrections are stored in the database for later
* Graphs are generated, showing the user's strengths and weaknesses
* Simple interface for adding new exam questions to the database
